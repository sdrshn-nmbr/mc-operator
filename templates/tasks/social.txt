I need to {{action}} on {{platform}} related to {{username}} {{content}}.

Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions for automating this social media interaction, including:

1. Navigating to the {{platform}} website
2. Handling any login or authentication requirements (without submitting credentials)
3. Finding {{username}}'s profile or content
4. Executing the requested {{action}} (summarize, view, scroll, etc.)
5. Capturing relevant information or content
6. Handling dynamic content loading and pagination
7. Extracting and presenting the required information

Consider these important aspects:
- Different layouts between desktop and mobile versions of {{platform}}
- Login walls and cookie consent dialogs
- Rate limiting and anti-automation measures
- Timeline-based content that may change between visits
- Best practices for finding and identifying specific posts or content
- Methods for extracting text, images, or engagement metrics

Provide specific selectors for each step, with alternate approaches if primary selectors fail.
Include JavaScript evaluation scripts to help identify and extract content.
Indicate points where human verification might be needed before proceeding.
