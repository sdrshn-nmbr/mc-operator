I need to search for information about {{query}} and collect the results.

Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions for automating this search, including:

1. Determining the best search engine or website to use for this query
2. Navigating to the chosen site
3. Entering the search query "{{query}}"
4. Interpreting the search results
5. Extracting relevant information from the top results
6. Navigating to detailed pages if needed
7. Collecting and organizing the information

Consider these important aspects:
- Different search interfaces and result layouts
- How to handle paginated search results
- Extracting structured data vs. unstructured content
- Handling login walls or paywalls when accessing content
- Using advanced search operators if needed
- Saving or documenting the information found

Provide specific selectors for each step, with alternate approaches if primary selectors fail.
Include JavaScript evaluation scripts for extracting content when needed.
Recommend approaches for filtering results to find the most relevant information.
