5. **Setup Browserbase Download Handling**

   - This ensures we can capture downloads through the Browserbase API

6. **After Login - Dashboard**
   - Wait for div[data-testid="company-name"] to appear on the dashboard
   - Click on div[data-testid="company-name"] to open the dropdown menu
   - In the dropdown menu, find and click on the Admin account option using this evaluate code:
     \`\`\`javascript
     const adminOption = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('p.css-aa2st8-css-css')).find(p => p.textContent.includes('Admin account'));
     if (adminOption) adminOption.click();
     \`\`\`

7. **Reports Section**
   - Navigate directly to: https://app.rippling.com/reports/dashboard?tab=RECENT
   - Wait for the "Employee roster (minus comp)" report to appear
   - Click on p[data-testid="Employee roster (minus comp)"]

8. **Download Report**
   - Wait for the download icon to appear with span[data-icon="DOWNLOAD"]
   - Click on this icon
   - When the dropdown appears, click the Download button with button[data-testid="Download"]
   - Wait a moment for the download to complete (at least 5 seconds)

9. **Retrieve Downloaded Files**
   - After the download completes, check for downloads:
   - Use puppeteer_browserbase_download tool with mode="check"
   - This will confirm if the files were downloaded successfully
   - Then retrieve the files using puppeteer_browserbase_download with:
     \`\`\`javascript
     {
       mode: "get",
       downloadPath: "downloaded_files"
     }
     \`\`\`
   - This will save all downloaded files to the specified directory

### Important Notes
- For Browserbase, downloads are handled through their API
- The downloaded files will be Excel format (.xlsx)
- Use class selectors like "css-15mx1g9" rather than looking for text within buttons
- Wait for elements to appear before interacting with them
- For the dropdown menu items that can't be targeted with direct selectors, use evaluate()
- Make sure to set up the download handling before attempting any downloads
- The download process has three steps:
  1. Setup the download behavior
  2. Perform the download action
  3. Retrieve the downloaded files using the API
