# Login Automation Task

Create a detailed, step-by-step login automation plan for website authentication.

## Task Description
Automate the process of logging into a website with user credentials.

## Required Steps

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Locate and fill in the username/email field
3. Locate and fill in the password field
4. Submit the login form
5. Handle any additional authentication steps (2FA, security questions, etc.)
6. Verify successful login
7. Handle errors appropriately (invalid credentials, account locked, etc.)

## Specific Instructions
Write a detailed automation script that uses available Puppeteer tools to accomplish the login task. Your script should:

1. Start with navigating to the login page of the website
2. Include specific selectors for username and password fields
3. Add appropriate waits before and after form submission
4. Handle common login errors and challenges:
   - Captchas (prompt user for input if needed)
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Security questions
   - "Remember this device" prompts
   - Browser notifications
5. Verify successful login by checking for elements only visible to logged-in users
6. Include fallback strategies if the primary login method fails

### Tips for Robust Login Automation
- Wait for form fields to be fully loaded before interacting
- Check for alternative login methods (e.g., SSO, social login) if main method fails
- Be prepared to handle overlays, popups, or notices that may appear during login
- Add explicit verification that each field was filled correctly before submission
- For high-security sites, be ready to handle step-up authentication

Provide your automation steps as a numbered sequence, with each step clearly describing one specific action to take.
