I need to find and play media content related to {{content}} on {{platform}}.

Please provide detailed step-by-step instructions for automating this media task, including:

1. Navigating to the {{platform}} website
2. Searching for "{{content}}"
3. Filtering results to find the most relevant content
4. Selecting the specific content to play
5. Setting up playback options (quality, subtitles, etc.)
6. Handling autoplay, suggested content, and ads
7. Interacting with the media player as needed

Consider these important aspects:
- Different layouts between desktop and mobile versions
- Login requirements or cookie walls
- Advertisement interruptions
- Consent dialogs and age verification prompts
- Platform-specific features (playlists, queues, channels)
- Keyboard shortcuts for media control

Provide specific selectors for each step, with alternate approaches if primary selectors fail.
Include JavaScript evaluation scripts for interacting with the media player when needed.
Suggest methods for handling common issues like regional restrictions or premium content limitations.
