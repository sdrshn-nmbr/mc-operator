# Form Filling Automation Task

Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for filling and submitting a form on a website.

## Task Description
Automate the process of navigating to a form, filling in the required fields, and submitting it.

## Required Steps

1. Navigate to the page containing the form
2. Locate all form fields (text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.)
3. Fill in each field with appropriate data
4. Handle any validation or dynamic form behavior
5. Submit the form
6. Verify successful submission
7. Handle any post-submission steps or confirmations

## Specific Instructions
Write a detailed automation script that uses available Puppeteer tools to accomplish the form filling task. Your script should:

1. Start with navigating to the page containing the form
2. Include specific selectors for each form field
3. Fill each field with appropriate data:
   - Text inputs using puppeteer_fill
   - Dropdowns using puppeteer_select
   - Checkboxes and radio buttons using puppeteer_click
4. Handle special form elements:
   - Date pickers
   - File uploads
   - Rich text editors
   - Multi-select fields
5. Verify each field is filled correctly before submission
6. Submit the form and verify success
7. Handle common form challenges:
   - Client-side validation
   - CAPTCHA or anti-bot measures
   - Multi-step forms
   - Dynamically appearing fields

### Tips for Robust Form Automation
- Wait for form elements to be fully loaded before interacting
- Check for validation messages after filling each field
- For complex forms, fill and submit in logical sections
- Verify successful submission by checking for confirmation messages or URL changes
- Have fallback strategies for different form layouts or behaviors
- Add appropriate delays between actions to mimic human behavior

Provide your automation steps as a numbered sequence, with each step clearly describing one specific action to take.
